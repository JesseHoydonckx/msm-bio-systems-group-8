# Assignment 2: Epidemiological Model - Parameter Exploration

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to explore the dynamics of an epidemiological SIRD model by analyzing the impact of varying recovery rates on epidemic outcomes. The tasks include implementing the SIRD model, running simulations for different parameter values, analyzing results, and visualizing the outcomes. This assignment aims to deepen understanding of disease spread and the effects of interventions.

## Instructions to Run the Code

1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system.
   - Install the required Python libraries using the following command:

        ```bash
        pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy
        ```

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the `assignment-2.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to complete the tasks.

3. **Output**:
   - The notebook will generate tables summarizing the results for each recovery rate, including metrics like peak infections, total deaths, and basic reproduction number (Râ‚€).
   - It will also produce publication-quality plots showing epidemic curves and comparative visualizations for different scenarios.

## Notes

- The specific instructions for this assignment can be found in the [assignment description](https://mkutmon.gitlab.io/epidemiological-models/assignment.html).
- The notebook includes detailed explanations for each task, providing insights into the behavior of the SIRD model under varying conditions.
- This folder contains `assignment-2.pdf`, which is the exported notebook with our final outputs. In case any issues arise while running the notebook, this PDF serves as a backup.
