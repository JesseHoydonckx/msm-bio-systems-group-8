    "    In this case, the maximal reaction activities in a linear pathway are not equal to each other. If for example we look at the lower glycolysis pathway we get the following sequence of reaction activities:\n",

    "\n",
    "    The first obvious reaction type are exchange reactions. If we specifically look at Ex_glc_D_e and EX_fru_e for example, they are empty and have no data. These specific reactions show the transport of that substance across the cell boundary. Gene expression data is not useful in this case for maximal activity as their rate is not only dependant on the number of expressed transport proteins. Also if there is no glucose or fructose in this case coming from an external environment the reaction rate is always zero.   \n",
    "\n",
    "    The second reaction type would be Biomass, in this case we very clearly have BIOMASS_Ecoli_cor_w_GAM that has no data at all. The process it describes the one of cell growth, using precursor metabolites to simulate that. Since there is no gene that encodes such a process it is therefore not possible to get a maximal activity value from it only based on gene expression data. "
