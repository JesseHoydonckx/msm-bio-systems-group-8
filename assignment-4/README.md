# Assignment 4: Pathogen Infection Model - Simulation and Analysis

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to analyze a model of pathogen infection in plant tissue. The model simulates how a pathogen secretes a chemical that weakens cell walls, facilitating infection. The tasks include running simulations, analyzing the effects of varying parameters, and proposing a defense mechanism for the plant.

## Instructions to Run the Model

1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Ensure the required simulation software is installed on your system.
   - Open the provided model file in the simulation environment.

2. **Run the Model**:
   - Run the model as-is for 4 hours.
   - Document observations by taking screenshots at the initial time point and at every hour.

3. **Analyze the Code**:
   - Review the `CellHouseKeeping` section of the code and describe its functionality.
   - Compare the equations in the `cell-to-cell transport` and `cell dynamics` sections to the provided network sketch. Identify missing information, complete the sketch, and include it in your documentation.

4. **Parameter Adjustment**:
   - Adjust the diffusion coefficient for the pathogen’s chemical:
     - Decrease it by a factor of 10 and run the simulation.
     - Increase it by a factor of 10 and run the simulation.
   - Document the results and describe the observed changes.

5. **Propose a Defense Mechanism**:
   - Assume the plant develops a defense mechanism that detects the pathogen’s chemical and signals uninfected cells to strengthen their walls.
   - Propose how this mechanism could be implemented in the model using pseudo-code.

## Notes

- Document all observations, including screenshots and descriptions, in this README file.
- Include the completed network sketch as an image file in this folder.
- Provide detailed explanations for each task to ensure clarity.

## Use of Generative AI Tools

We used generative AI tools to help write and proofread this README file. AI was only used for documentation support, not for generating code or analysis. All generated output has been reviewed and modified by a human.
